## What does KTMConnect do?
> KTMConnect is a webapp which allows users to track buses running nearby them. This will help to save time by estimating the arrival time of buses and reducing the waiting time. Additionally, it will help users to get the route information of various bus services running around the city. 

## Tech stacks used?
-> **ReactJs** for frontend.

-> **Bing Maps API** for the integrating maps and locating buses within the website.

-> **Axios** for fetching the api.

-> **Tailwind (postcss, autoprefixer) and framer-motion** to make the UI better.

-> **react-router-dom** for Routing through various pages.

-> **express and faker** used to generate random location coordinates.

-> **emailjs** for mailing services through the website.

## Future Enhancements?
> This site is currently its development phase. The random locations fetched will be soon replaced with the real time location of buses through GPS technology. Users will be able to search their desired bus service and estimate the arrival times. Using cameras and Machine Learning, we may be able to get the available seats services to the website.
